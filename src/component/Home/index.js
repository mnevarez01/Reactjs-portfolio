      I recently acquired a certification in Full Stack Web Development from the University of
                Denver with skills in JavaScript, CSS, React.js, MongoDB, Nodejs., and MySQL. Known as problem-solver,
                task-orientated and great collaborator. I aim to create a great user experience by creating great
                user-driven websites as well as using back-end servers to optimize use. Recent projects have led me to
                create a user-friendly app to research weather in multiple cities. The fast pace of the certification
                process has set me up to deal with the fast and ever-changing technology field. Excited to use my time
                management, dedication and eye for detail to ensure that creating an excellent user experience.
